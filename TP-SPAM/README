TP SPAM tries over and over to get you into a busy sim so you can be the first of your friends to buy stuff at the latest, busy shopping event.

v1 teleports you based on a landmark placed inside the object.
v2 can hold up to 12 landmarks inside and can also take direct text input of the location.

These scripts will probably not work in OpenSimulator.
